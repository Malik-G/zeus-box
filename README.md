Made with React, Node, Google Firebase, this project is a proof of concept for a gog gifiting company named Zeus Box.

The benefits I gained from doing this project were practicing web development with Firebase, practicing advanced CSS techniques, and to picking up new tips and tricks in React.

Feel free to visit the site, make an account, and test it out. User authentication is handled via Firebase, and your email doesn't have to be real to sign up.
